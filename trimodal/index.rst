Trimodal single-cell omics
==========================

A few different technologies have been demonstrated that enable high-throughput profiling of three modalities.

For instance, [TEA-seq](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63632) and [DOGMA-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00927-2) enable gene expression, chromatin accessibility and surface protein profiling. [NEAT-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01461-y) profiles nuclear proteins in addition to RNA and ATAC modalities.

The notebooks below demonstrate how to load and process some of these datasets:
